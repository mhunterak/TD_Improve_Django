# DONE:

# Use django-debug-toolbar to find places where database queries run too long
# or hit the database too many times. Twice is okay, I think. <60 ms is my target.

# Use the provided requirements.txt to install needed packages for the project

# install django-debug-toolbar

# Check that models are using appropriate fields for the type of data they
# store. If not, correct them and create migrations to handle the data.

# Use coverage.py to check the code coverage amount. 

# Write tests to increase test coverage to at least 75%.

# Decrease combined query time on all views to 60ms or less.

# Add migrations to correct existing data when data types change.

# Use django-debug-toolbar to find places where templates aren't properly using
# inheritance.

# Check that forms are using the correct fields and validation. If not, fix.

# EXTRA CREDIT: 
# Increase test coverage to 90% or above.
# Add custom form validators
