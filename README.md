# Treehouse Python Techdegree Project 9: Improve a Django Project 
Take a messy, buggy, badly tested Python code base and improve it. Start with a Django app and identify where it's broken and inefficient. Write and run tests, check for proper validation, analyze views and analyze database calls to improve the site.

# I AM AIMING FOR THE 'EXCEEDS EXPECTATIIONS' GRADE ON THIS PROJECT!

> Steps to get the project running.

0. Initialize a new virtual environment of your choosing. I use:
    `python -m venv .env` and `source .env/bin/activate`

A predefined build task has been made for users of Visual Studio code in `.vscode/tasks.json`

Or:

1. Use the `pip install -r requirements.txt` file to install the project dependencies.

2. Run your migrations to create the tables in the database.
   `python manage.py migrate`

3. Run the server.
   `python manage.py runserver`
